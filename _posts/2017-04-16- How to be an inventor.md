Reading notes from “The Innovation Algorithm”

# Psychological Barriers
## What stops invention
### “one of the eternal problem”
“Invention problems always have an intimidating tinge”. 
If it is a mathematical problem, people know if it is solvable or unbeatable with knowledge and experience from the past. But when it comes to invention problems, the problem always come as “one of the eternal problem”, intimidating people from every respect. It doesn’t matter if it is difficult problem. **Not everyone can show the bravery needed to conquer an “eternal problem”.  ** — 我也没有。当我发现这个问题进入貌似没解的状态，我就停了。
### The story of 3 phases of innovators’ creativity ( search, waiting period, illumination)
We all heard the story of how great inventions come to inventors’ mind. 
First, an inventor intensely and unsuccessfully searches for a solutions;
Second, having not solved the problem, he stops thinking about it. 
Third, some time passes, and suddenly, as if a delayed-action mechanism goes off — “as it by itself” — the required solutions appears. 

#### False Impression: 
We highlight the 3rd phase”suddenly an idea appears” and conclude that the path of innovation is not traceable.  

#### “Aha “ : 
2nd phases helps break the habitual “bond”. 
Phase 1 Search: A problem is formulated ( with terminology possessing inertia, and secretly forces thought into the direction opposite to where new ideas are present. )
![]()
![]()
Phase 2: the interaction between parts are weaken and weaken until they break completely. 
![]()
Then the inventor can easily reposition the parts, change the character of the interaction between them as so on. As a result, a new formation of the system appears. 
![]()

### Machines are born weak, slowly gaining strength by absorbing many inventions. (Part 1-5)
A naive and widespread opinion: new machines, mechanisms, and devices appear from out of nowhere. in the beginning there is nothing — then a great inventor comes along and develops a completely finished something. 
Machines do not appear from inside the head of an inventor completely “armed”. 
*IFR ensured its direction. *

### There is no eternal problem as long as it doesn’t break the laws of nature
The Law of Conservation and Law of Dialectics are not breakable. for other types of problems, the impossibility if only temporary. 
Theoretically, all this is simple: just don’t be afraid of the word “ impossible”. In practice, **bravery accumulates gradually during the process of solving problems that seem unsolvable. **Lots of people tried, but not found the best solution. It is not in vain that the scientists found nothing can be done here.  Each unsuccessful attempt to solve it reduces the degree of uncertainty along with the search field. 
1. time;  
2. direction
3. the arsenal of technology continually grows.

### “Aha” moment for breaking Psychological Barriers , challenging status quo:
Imagination must be systematically developed through special exercises. 
1. An imaginary planet, Arktur IV.
Its surface temperature is 100’ lower than on Earth, its atmosphere consists of methane, its oceans are made of ammonia, its gravity is ten times stronger than Earth’s, and its intelligent beings are birds. 
Think about automobiles, or houses for Arktura IV. This actually was an interview question from Google. 
2. How are you going to communicate with the visitors from other planet? if time is not linear, what may happen?
![]()
3. the spoon - the Cognitive Illusion and the status quo.
![]()
“Never try to bend the spoon. It is impossible. Instead, try to realize the truth: there is no spoon. It is not the spoon that bends. It is only yourself. “
4. “Make the impossible possible, make invisible visible”
i used to like keep this quote as my motto. But now I think it might be wrong. If you already think it is impossible, how could you make it possible? 

## The value of SF
### What SF means to our life
![]()
### The power of Fantasy
Science fiction literature is the way to increase imagination and visualize the solution. SF helps** overcome psychological barriers** on the road to “crazy”ideas without which science cannot continue its development. Whatever a human being can imagine, others can make reality.  The bold idea has a higher probability of realization than the conservative one. 
### Examples?
1. *Wall-E* Eva
![]()
2.  3D print
![]()
3. GPS Tracking
![]()
4. iRobot
![]()
5. Wheelless car — hovercraft

#### the SF scientists
1. Jules Verne
2. H.G.Wells
3. time machine
3. Alexander Belyaev

## Other things to help remove barriers and increase innovation potential
Imagination must be systematically developed through special exercises. 
1. Study “ leading” industries;
The word “leading” is in quotation because its meaning, from an inventor’s perspective, is relative. The inventor must constantly keep track of problems solved today in leading industries because similar problems can appear in the inventor’s own industry tomorrow. 
2. Study “ follow” industries’ fields of technology
The better the inventor understands the lagging areas in “follower” fields, the wider he can utilize a new technical idea obtained from within a problem’s solution. 
3. Collect information about physical effects, new materials, methods for solving technical problems, and so on.
Direct principle vs opposite principle
4. Study patent information.
It increase an inventor’s creative potential. 
5. Keep track of literature on inventive creativity theory
6. Accumulate experience in solving exercise problems
7. Learn creative thinking 
8. Make correct the choice of task


# The Innovation Algorithm - Remove / reduce contradictions
## The inventions
### Five level of inventions
Altshuller analyzed 14 classes of inventions from 1965-1969 revealing the following dispersal:
![]()

1.  77% of registered inventions represent only **new designs**.
2.  Sub-levels of Level Five, and the higher ones are involved with the utilization of **new discoveries**.
3.  It is typical that today’s inventive creativity belongs in the range between the Third and mid-Fifth Levels.
“A-ha” - this is also explained, why design is not the one, at least not the only important one to make difference. 
### Traditional method to get invention
The tragedy of the inventing process is that people use methods for higher level problem solving that are relevant only to the lower levels. 
1. Trail and error - weakness: efficiency
![]()
2. Heuristic Method (reduce cognitive loads through categorization, etc)
Nature didn’t develop higher level heuristic methods because of the lengthy time needed for each cycle. A person simply did not have time to accumulate heuristic experience while developing one or two Fourth Level inventions. 

3. Brainstorming
![]()
4. Synectics Method
- Direct Analogy
- Personal Analogy
- Symbolic Analogy
- Imaginary Analogy

## There is a systematic way
1. Ideal Machine — IFR
The “Ideal Machine” is a fundamental concept of inventive methodology. 
2. Technical Contradiction
An invention is the removal of technical contradictions. People cannot become an inventor if you don’t learn to clearly see the contradictions in objects.

Utilizing the concepts of **Ideal machine** and **Technical Contradiction **make it possible to substantially control the process of solving inventive problems. Ideal Machine helps to determine** the direction to search**, while the Technical contradiction indicates **the obstacle that must be removed. **

The essence of a theory for creativity lies in this: problems today that are considered creative can be solved on a new level of structured mental processes that will not exist until tomorrow. 

by contradictions
3. Operator STC

### Before we start — the pitfall — define the problem
An isolated contradiction doesn’t appear all by itself. It is necessary to find a way to remove it. 
#### How the question is given

#### The importance of the context
